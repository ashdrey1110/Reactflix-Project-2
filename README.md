## Introduction

**Problem Statement:** Reactflix - The better Netflix. In a world overwhelmed by too many shows and recommendations, Reactflix offers a truly personalized experience with no ads and a straightforward approach. Users can search for new shows, add them to their list, or view what's trending. (Note: Actual streaming is not currently available.)

**Goal of this project:** The aim is to emulate the design structure of Netflix using the TV Maze API. When users visit the homepage, they are presented with the site's current top 5 trending shows. Directly below, any shows the user has favorited will be displayed. 

In the navigation menu at the top right, users can search for shows or click "Random" to be taken to any show listed on the site. Clicking on any show's banner will lead to a details page, providing basic information about the show. This page also includes functionality for favoriting the show and rating it from 1 to 5 stars.
